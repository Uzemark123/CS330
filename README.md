What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The main new design skill I developed was enhanced visualization, learning how to translate my creative vision into successful design by effectively incorporating it into the 3D scene structure and elements.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The process was iterative: I began with basic object placement and gradually refined the design, focusing on lighting and texture application before finalizing the scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design approach I used can be applied in future projects by building and refining components gradually to create scalable, manageable environments.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used modular design to break down the project into manageable components, allowing me to reuse objects and reduce complexity.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a key role as I constantly refined my design, testing and adjusting textures, lighting, and positioning to achieve a more polished result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach evolved from focusing on basic scene setup to implementing more efficient coding practices, like modularizing classes, which helped streamline development and improve code readability.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics have given me a strong foundation in visualizing and analyzing complex data, which will be valuable in courses that require the interpretation of data in visual formats, such as simulations or modeling.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In my professional career, the skills I've gained in 3D modeling and visualization can be applied to fields like game development, simulation design, or any role requiring data-driven visual solutions, making me more versatile in tech-driven industries.
